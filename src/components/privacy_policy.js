      <h3>What Cookies and Web Beacons Are and How We and Others Use Them</h3>
      <p>Our Site may use various software technologies including “cookies,” “web beacons” and “pixel tags.” “Cookies” are small text files that we and others may place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any PI. "Web beacons" or “Pixel tags” are small pieces of code placed on a web page or within the body of an email to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page or viewing or opening an email. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time for this and advertising purposes.</p>
      
      <p>From time to time, we partner with third parties who may place cookies on your browser when you visit our Sites, may send their own cookies to your cookie file, and may use those cookies to track and collect information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites, devices, and applications and to provide targeted advertising based on your interests and previous browsing history.</p>
      <p>Certain third party ad networks may automatically collect information about your visits to our Sites and other websites, such as your IP address, your Internet service provider, and the browser you use to visit our Sites. They do this using cookies, web beacons or other technologies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or web beacons and other technologies in third party advertising. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of third party advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies, web beacons and other technology.</p>
  
      <h3>What Internet Protocol Addresses Are</h3>
      <p>An Internet protocol (“IP”) address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). Bookbild may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, to prevent our servers from being abused and for other uses described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      
      
      <h3>Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</h3>
      <p>Our Site may contain third party sites linked from our Site to other Web sites, including those of our partners and sponsors, whose information practices may be different from ours. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the activities of these third parties when they are collecting or using data for their own purpose or on behalf of others. Please consult the respective privacy policies and statements of such third parties for more information.</p>
  
      
      <h3>How We Secure and Store Your Information</h3>
      <p>We have put in place reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to help safeguard information we collect through our Sites. However, you should know that no company, including Bookbild, can fully eliminate security risks associated with PI. To help protect yourself, please use a strong password, do not use the same passwords to access your Bookbild accounts that you use with other accounts or services, and protect your user names and passwords to help prevent others from accessing your accounts and services.</p>
      <p>We will protect all personal information we obtain in accordance with this Privacy Policy and take reasonable steps to ensure that it is treated lawfully. PI we collect may be retained for as long as needed to fulfill legitimate business purposes, including the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, or for a period of time specifically required or allowed by applicable regulations or laws.</p>

      <h3>Use of Our Online Forums and Public Services</h3>
      <p>We offer you the ability to post information and exchange ideas through our online services. We may also offer ways to share through independent third party sites, plug-ins and online services. We are not responsible for the activities of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand how they user your information. Because your posts and information are public and can be seen by others, we caution all users to consider what they post and share online and not to disclose any PI as part of their posts, even if requested to do so by other posters. Bookbild will not be responsible in the event that you disclose PI in your posts, through our public services or during any other communication with other site users.</p>
  
      
      <h3>What Choices Do We Give You and How Can You Correct or Review Your Personal Information</h3>
      <p>Our marketing emails tell you how to "opt-out" of receiving further marketing emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you, and, as allowed by applicable law, requests for your participation in surveys. You may also contact us info@bookbild.com at any time to let us know that you no longer wish to receive further marketing emails.</p>
      <p>Upon request, we will provide an individual with access to identifying information that we have collected about them (provided that they have given adequate proof of identity). We also offer individuals the ability to have inaccuracies corrected within their contact information. You may also request deletion of your PI. We will honor requests as required by law and subject to our business and legal needs to retain your data. These information requests can be made by sending us an e-mail through the e-mail link provided above or writing to us at the above mailing address.</p>
      <p>When you use our Sites, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies from our servers. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our websites. Cookie management tools provided by your browser may not remove Flash cookies. If you delete your cookies, use a different browser, or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out choices.</p>
      <p>While we and others give you certain choices, as further outlined in this Policy, there are many ways that Web browser signals and similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and we may not be aware of nor honor every mechanism.</p>
